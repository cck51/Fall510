This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

abalonehist <- abalonehist + abline(v= smpl50d, col= "yellow")
abalonehist <- abalonehist + abline(v= smpl80d, col= "brown")


#9.Provide a brief explanation of what you observe in the measures and histograms as it relates to sample size and resampling.

#As we sample over 1000 iterations, the measures (min, max,mean,variance) as well as the shape of the histograms approach the measures and histograms of samples of 100% of the data.  This makes intuitive sense. If we were to take 1 sample of 1% of the data, the variance associated this would be quite high and our measure would be unreliable. However, as we approach a large number of iterations, this decreases the "luck" factor(i.e. the variance) that we get an unrepresentative sample, and our measures on those samples converge to that of the entire data set.


```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
